This is just a simple QR-Code Generator that I have programmed for myself to not be reliant on advertisement sites and be able to include logos in the middle of the Code.

It is far from perfect. E.g. there is no check, if the file you put in as a logo is an image or not or if you are typing in the code of a real color.
Also size is at the moment not changeable.

That is maybe on the roadmap for now.

Cheers.
